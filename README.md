**In this repository, the 'code' folder has all the Python program files used for the assignment and the 'documents' folder has all the image files.**

**Inside the 'code' folder, the screenshot folder contains all the screenshots used for the report. Following are the other Python files with their descriptions:**

1. **find_season_module.py**: This program takes the input (country and month) as parameters, and returns the season as an output if the input data is available in the provided data dictionary, otherwise returns 'Not found'.
2. **find_season_graphics_module.py**: This program is similar to 'find_season_module.py', however, the function displays the 'season image' instead of 'season'.
3. **check_temperature_module.py**: This program takes the input (city, time, temperature) as parameters and returns the output as 'Above' if the temperature is greater than the average temperature, 'Below' if the temperature is less than the average temperature, an additional message if the difference between input temperature and the average temperature is more than 5 and return 'Not found' if input data is not valid.
4. **main.py**: This program contains the main program that takes the console input from the user and passes the input to the module functions by calling them. And finally, the return value from these functions is printed.
5. **test_equivalence_find_season_module.py**: This program performs the equivalence partitioning black-box test for 'find_season_module.py'.
6. **test_equivalence_check_temperature_module.py**: This program performs the equivalence partitioning black-box test for 'check_temperature_module.py'.
7. **test_whitebox_find_season_module.py**: This program performs the white-box test for 'find_season_module.py'.
8. **test_whitebox_check_temperature_module.py**: This program performs the white-box test for 'check_temperature_module.py'.
9. **report.md**: Assignment report written in markdown format.
