# Module Description

> Submodule: find_season()
> 
> Input: country, month (String)
> 
> Output: season(String)
>
> If country and month exist in the available data, then return season else return "Not found".

The purpose of this module is to find the season using the month and country inputs. To keep track of the seasons for various nations and months, it uses a nested dictionary called seasons. The module returns the appropriate season after receiving the country and month as inputs. To handle case insensitivity, it converts the input to lowercase. It retrieves the season related to the country and month if they are found in the seasons dictionary. It returns a "Not found" message if it cannot be found.

Assumptions: The module assumes that the input country and month will be provided as strings and follows a specific format. It assumes that the season for a given country and month is pre-defined and available in the seasons dictionary. If the input does not match any valid country or month in the dictionary, it assumes that the season is not found and returns a "Not found" message.


> Submodule: check_temperature()
>
> Input: city(String), time(String), temperature(Float)
>
> Output: message(String)
>
> If the temperature is greater than the average temperature and the difference is more than 5, then return an additional message otherwise return 'Above'. ElseIf the difference is less then, return 'Below', else return 'Not found'.

Based on the city, time, and temperature inputs, this module was developed to check the current temperature status. To keep track of the average temperatures for various cities and times, it uses the dictionary average_temperatures. The module compares the provided temperature with the typical temperature for the specified city and time after receiving the city, time, and temperature as inputs. If the temperature is higher, lower, or the difference is more than 5°C compared to the average temperature, it returns a message stating that information.

Assumptions: The module assumes that the input city and time will be provided as strings and follows a specific format. It assumes that the average temperatures for different cities and times are pre-defined and available in the average_temperatures dictionary. If the input does not match any valid city, time, or temperature in the dictionary, it assumes that the data is not found and returns a "Not found" message.

The module descriptions were unchanged following the refactoring. The process of refactoring concentrated on enhancing the modularity, readability, and structure of the code. The intended tasks, behaviors, inputs, or outputs of the modules were not altered in any way.

# Modularity

The find_season() and check_temperature() modules demonstrate several modularity concepts in their implementation. These modules are a part of a larger program, the main program, which receives input from the console and passes it as parameters to the corresponding function calls. The desired output is then generated by printing the returned values. 

In these modules a specific functionalities are encapsulated within each module. While check_temperature() assesses the temperature status based on the city, time, and temperature inputs, find_season() determines the season based on the country and month. This encapsulation allows for modular development and maintenance of the code, making it easier to understand and modify.

By giving the modules straightforward interfaces, abstraction is made possible. The required inputs and the expected output type are both specified in the function signatures. By hiding the internal implementation details of the modules, this abstraction enables the user to interact with them without having to understand the underlying logic.


The following features are included in the code review checklist:

1. Check if the code is divided into meaningful modules and if each module has a clear purpose.
2. Make sure the input parameters are properly validated and handled to prevent unexpected errors.
3. Review the usage of data structures such as dictionaries to store and retrieve relevant information.
4. Check the code for adherence to coding standards, proper indentation, and understandable variable and function names.
5. Check if appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place to handle invalid input or unexpected situations.


The review using the checklist revealed the following results:

1. Both modules demonstrate clear and focused functionality, addressing specific tasks related to season finding and temperature checking.
2. To handle case insensitivity, the code handles input validation by changing inputs to lowercase, ensuring consistency.
3. Dictionary-based data structures make it possible to store and retrieve relevant data for module operations quickly and effectively.
4. The use of meaningful variable and function names, consistent indentation, and proper coding practices all contribute to the code's readability and maintainability.
5. When input does not match any valid data in the dictionaries, the modules handle the situation by displaying a clear "Not found" message.

By conducting the review and making sure the checklist is followed, the code demonstrates good modularity, proper input handling, efficient data structure usage, code style, readability, and error handling, leading to a reliable and maintainable software solution.

To run the production code containing the 'find_season()' and 'check_temperature()' modules, a main file 'main.py' is created which takes the keyboard input from users and passes the input as parameters by calling the functions present in these modules. Then, the following steps needs to be followed: 

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the 'main.py' file is located.
3. Run the code using the command: 'python main.py'.



# Black-box Test Cases

### **Equivalence Partitioning for find_season module**

| Category | Test Data| Expected Result|
| -------- | -------- | ---------------|
| Valid Equivalence Class: Country and Month exist in available data | country='Australia', month='December'| ['Summer','Birak'] |
| Invalid Equivalence Class: Country or Month does not exist in the available data | country='Denmark', month='March' | 'Not found' |
| Invalid Equivalence Class: Empty Country or Month | country=' ', month='June' | 'Not found' |
| Invalid Equivalence Class: Country or Month Invalid Input Type (eg: numeric input) | country=123, month='july' | 'Not found' |

These test cases include a variety of inputs, such as various countries and months. They are designed to verify that, given the inputs for the given country and month, the find_season() module returns the appropriate season. Each test case represents a unique set of inputs and the expected output for those inputs. The test cases include situations where the output is a single season or a list of seasons, as well as situations where the country or month is not found in the seasons dictionary and the output is "Not found.". By creating these test cases, we make sure the module correctly handles a variety of input configurations and produces the desired outcomes.


### **Equivalence Partitioning for check_temperature module**

| Category | Test Data| Expected Result|
| -------- | -------- | ---------------|
| Test case for difference more than 5 | city='Perth', time='morning', temperature=25| 'additional message' |
| Test case for 'Above' | city='Adelaide', time='evening' temperature=25 | 'Above' |
| Test case for 'Below' | city='Perth', time='evening' temperature=15 | 'Below' |
| Test case for Invalid data | city='Norway', time='ale' temperature=6653 | 'Not found' |

By offering various input combinations, these test cases demonstrate the check_temperature() module's functionality. Each test case represents a specific situation in which the module, given the inputs for the city, time, and temperature, should return the correct temperature status. The test cases include scenarios where the temperature is above, below, or when the city or time cannot be found in the dictionary of average_temperatures, resulting in the output "Not found.". One of the test cases gives an additional message as an output if the difference between the given temperature and the average temperature is more than positive 5. We make sure the module accurately handles various input combinations and provides the anticipated temperature status by creating these test cases.

These "black-box" test cases cover a range of scenarios and input combinations in order to verify the correctness and robustness of the modules. They offer a methodical approach to testing the modules' functionality without taking into account the specifics of their internal implementation.


# White-box Test Cases

**In "White Box" testing, test cases are based on the paths through a method/function.**

White-box testing ensures that we test each path - each possible way through the production code. Each path becomes a test case.

White-box testing seeks to assess the accuracy and efficacy of the code itself, as opposed to black-box testing, which is concerned with testing the functionality of the software without knowledge of its internal workings. It involves testing specific code branches, paths, and functions to make sure they work as intended and can handle a range of inputs and scenarios.

### **Test cases for find_season module**

| Path | Test Data| Expected Result|
| ---- | -------- | ---------------|
| Enter the 'if' condition | country='Australia', month='June'| ['Winter','Makuru'] |
| Do not enter the 'if' condition | country='France', month='September' | 'Not found' |

### **Test cases for check_temperature module**

| Path | Test Data| Expected Result|
| ---- | -------- | ---------------|
| Enter the third 'if' condition | city='Perth', time='morning', temperature=25 | 'additional message' |
| Enter the first 'else' condition | city='Perth', time='morning', temperature=20 | 'Above' |
| Enter the second 'else' condition | city='Adelaide', time='evening', temperature=19 | 'Below' |
| Enter the outer 'else' condition | city='Norway', time='ale', temperature=6653 | 'Not found' |


White-box testing focuses on the internal implementation and structure of the software. It supports a thorough testing approach by helping to find flaws, verify the correctness of the code, and provide insights into its behaviour and performance.
